Copy the source code to Moodle return box. Alternatively you can paste a link to GitLab. If using GitLab, verify that you have added at least a Reporter permission for the lecturer.

[x]Create a source file math.ex and declare a module Math.
[x]Declare functions Math.add, Math.sub, Math.mul, and Math.div, each taking two parameters.
[x]Declare a private function Math.info which prints info from above public functions

[]The Math.add calls Math.info which prints "Adding x and y" (x and y the actual parameters to Math.add)
Use Math.info similarly from sub, mul and div functions.

[]Create a source file calculator.ex and declare module Calculator.
[]Declare a function Calculator.calc that takes a string parameter.

From string parameter, parse a number, operator (+,-,*,/) and second number, for example 123+456
Call the corresponding Math function based on parsed operator and two numbers.



Â 

[]Create a script that has a loop that asks a string from user
The text user enters is passed to Calculator.calc function
Exit the loop if user enters text that does not parse correctly in Calculator.calc
